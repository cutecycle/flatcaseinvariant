"convert flatcase to camelcase"

"convert flat case to camelcase"

"convert lowercase with no separators to camelcase"

going from any casing convention to flatcase is lossy.
```
lower(LocalHost) = 'localhost'
upper(localhost) = ???
```

This is because casing is an invention of man. The casing of words changes over time, the meaning of words changes over time, and the judgment of programmers changes over time.

The only way to accomplish this is to not care.

The way to accomplish this consistently is to not care in the *exact same way every time*.

## 2021, A word is born: Cheug
This specification MUST include casing the word Cheug.

## 2034, A compound word is born: McCheug
This specification MUST include Mc and Cheug.

## 2097, A word disappears: Cheug
Of the five remaining humans on the last mile of habitable land on earth, one is a software engineer.

"What's Cheug?"

"who cares, it's in the list"


## 3298: A phrase becomes a single word
Two cyborgs warp-speed to the 3E9th floor of the Third Saturnine Arcology for a game jam. 

"McCheug? must be how they spelled it in old english"

"It's in the ancient texts, we might as well keep it"
